# Django Learning Path: Projects 1–10

Welcome to the Django Application Development with SQL and Databases learning path! This workspace contains a series of hands-on Django projects, each building on the previous one to help you master Django, SQL, and database integration.

## Learning Path Overview

1. **First Django Model**
   - Learn to define and use Django models and ORM basics.
2. **Standalone Django ORM Project**
   - Use Django ORM outside a full Django project for scripts and automation.
3. **CRUD on Django Model Object**
   - Practice Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with Django models.
4. **Django First Project with Docker**
   - Containerize a Django project using Docker for easy deployment.
5. **Online Course Django Admin**
   - Customize the Django admin interface for a course management app.
6. **Django Views and Templates**
   - Build dynamic web pages using Django views and templates.
7. **Class-Based and Generic Views**
   - Use class-based and generic views for scalable web applications.
8. **Django Authentication**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization features.
9. **Bootstrap Integration**
   - Integrate Bootstrap for responsive web design in Django.
10. **Final Project: Online Course Platform**
    - Combine all concepts to build a full-featured online course platform with assessment features and cloud deployment support.
   - Build a complete online course platform that integrates all previous concepts: models, views, authentication, Bootstrap, and cloud deployment.
   - Features include course listing, enrollment, user registration/login, assessments/quizzes, admin management, and IBM Cloud Foundry deployment support.
   - See the 10_diango-project-onlinecourse folder for code, setup instructions, and ER diagram.

## How to Use This Workspace
- Each project is self-contained in its own folder (01–10).
- Follow the README.md in each project for setup and instructions.
- Use the provided virtual environments and requirements.txt files for dependencies.
- Progress through the projects in order for the best learning experience.


# Ideas for next-level Django Project

Here are some ideas for a next-level Django project:

1. **REST API with Django REST Framework**  
   Build a RESTful API for your online course platform, allowing external apps or frontend frameworks (like React) to interact with your data.

2. **User Profiles and Social Features**  
   Add user profile pages, avatars, and social features like following other users, messaging, or activity feeds.

3. **E-commerce Integration**  
   Implement course payments using Stripe or PayPal, with order history and receipts.

4. **Advanced Search and Filtering**  
   Add full-text search, filtering, and sorting for courses using Django Haystack or Elasticsearch.

5. **Progress Tracking and Certificates**  
   Track learner progress, quiz scores, and generate downloadable certificates upon course completion.

6. **Mobile App Backend**  
   Design your Django project as a backend for a mobile app, exposing APIs and handling authentication.

7. **Admin Analytics Dashboard**  
   Create a dashboard for admins/instructors with charts and statistics on enrollments, course popularity, and user engagement.

8. **Content Management System (CMS) Features**  
   Allow instructors to create and manage course content, lessons, and quizzes through a custom CMS interface.

9. **Notifications and Email Integration**  
   Send email or in-app notifications for enrollments, course updates, or deadlines.

10. **Gamification**  
    Add badges, leaderboards, and achievements to increase user engagement.
