# Introduction to Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern and encourages clean, pragmatic design.

## Key Features
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Interact with databases using Python objects instead of SQL.
- **Admin Interface:** Auto-generated admin panel for managing application data.
- **Security:** Built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for both small and large-scale applications.
- **Reusability:** Modular apps and reusable code components.

## Typical Workflow
1. Define models (database schema) in Python.
2. Use Django ORM to interact with the database.
3. Create views to handle business logic and user requests.
4. Design templates for rendering HTML pages.
5. Configure URLs to map requests to views.

## Why Use Django?
- Rapid development with less code.
- Batteries-included: comes with authentication, sessions, forms, and more.
- Large, active community and extensive documentation.
